# Economic Effects of Raising the Federal Minimum Wage
For this project, I have downloaded United States economic data going back to 1968, looking specifically at Federal Minimum Wage, Unemployment, the Consumer Price Index, Gross Domestic Product Per Capita, and Median Personal Income.  All of this data was obtained through the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED).
The goal of the project is to determine what effects minimum wage raises have on these other economic indicators, and the statistical significance of these effects.  To do this, I am utilitizing A/B testing and Hypothesis testing to determine how these economic indicators perform differently immediately after Federal minimum wage increases, as compared to periods where there has been no recent increase.
